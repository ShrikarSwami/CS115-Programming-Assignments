| Task 1: Describe your testing strategy. How did you group possible inputs?   |
| What are the edge cases?                                                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
I tried some super basic tests, but then I also tried a bunch of super outlandish test like 100, 2000000, etc. This allowed for me to not only find things that should be right but also 

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Task 1: Which of the provided 5 implementations are correct? For the         |
| incorrect ones, when do they give the wrong answer?                          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Implantation 1 is wrong because it could accept 13 months

Implentation 2 works!

Implentation 3 works!

Implentation 4 does not work because it does not recognize a valid date as valid

Implantation 5 thinks a nonexistent date exists which is wrong

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Task 2: Describing *every step you took* to find the mistake in              |
| vali_date_buggy_but_fixable.                                                 |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
First I ran my original test cases from the original 5 implementations and I found that novemeber 8th returned as false (that's my birthday) so I then went line by line with 11 as the month and 8 as the day and made sure to focus on which line messed up which happened to be because of a < symbol pointing in the incorrect direction

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Task 2: Where and what was the mistake in vali_date_buggy_but_fixable?       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
The mistake was an incorrect user of a greater than or equal symbol

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Put your answer here.
I generally could not figure out how to actually run the tests so after figuring it out it was pretty smooth sailing after that
