+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
method_1: Reference Duplication

method_2: Shallow Copy

method_3: Shallow Copy

method_4: Reference Duplication (ID of the original)

method_5: Shallow Copy

method_6: Shallow Copy

method_7: Shallow Copy

method_8: Deep Copy

| Task 2.2: How did you figure out the above? What strategies did you choose   |
| to use? What limitations did you encounter?                                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Put your answer here.
The way I figured it out is by comparing the id because that shows the position in memory and if it is a reference (meaning exact same id and first value), shallow copy (meaning different list value, but same id for first value, or deep copy (where Id was different for everything)

Put your answer here.
Basically the problem I had was I wasn't making a true deep copy like I was going over the first time but then I wasn't going down on a deeper level like 1, 2

For the second I kept messing up the base cases and putting them down as wrong
