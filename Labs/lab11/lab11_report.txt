| Mistake 1: What is the most recent line of code run when the error occured?  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Put your answer here.
The error happens on the line where the code is trying to accumulate the regeneration points:
total += item_quantity * item.regeneration_points

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Mistake 1: What function was calling that function?                          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Put your answer here.
The line is in compute_total_regeneration_points_in_inventory which was called from the top level code

Put your answer here.
Python basically tried to use += to add an integer value into a list accumulator so total was initialized as a list and when a list if using += ion python it expects the right to be an utterable value so that its contents can be concatenated onto the list. Because item_quantity becomes and int Python cannot iterate which leads to the error we got.

Put your answer here.
The failure again happens at the accumulation step inside compute_total_regeneration_points_in_inventory:
total += item_quantity * item.regeneration_points.

| Mistake 2: What function was calling that function?                          |

Put your answer here.
it’s still inside compute_total_regeneration_points_in_inventory, called by the main code.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Mistake 2: Explain in your own words what the error means                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Put your answer here.
This time total is an integer, which is correct. But one of the items, "ginger", has its regeneration_points stored as a tuple (10,) instead of just 10. When Python multiplies a tuple by a number, it stays a tuple. So it tries to do total += (tuple), which doesn’t work because you can’t add a tuple to an integer. You need to change (10,) to 10, or otherwise convert it to a number.
