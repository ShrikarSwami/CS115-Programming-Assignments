| 1. How does the coins value change for frames deeper (further down) in the   |
| stack?                                                                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
The coin list becomes shorter until there is nothing left in it.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. How does the total value change for frames deeper (further down) in the   |
| stack?                                                                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
The total value remains the same for the entire program 

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. What was the first return value you observed?                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
The first return value I observed was 1

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4 and 5. Code that called the function which returned that return value      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
coin_change((5,10,25),25)

| Did you encounter any problems while doing this assignment? If so, how did   |
| you resolve them?                                                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
I had many problems, I couldn't conceptually think of the code that I had to write to actually achieve this program and it took me a really long time to figure it out even after asking the CA's and my peers (Ethan) 

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Do you have any additional comments about this assignment?                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Coding is getting very hard and I think I need to figure out a way to practice programming simple things and get more complicated.
