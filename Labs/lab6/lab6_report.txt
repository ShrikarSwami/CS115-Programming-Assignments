| Task 1: Give the base 5 representation of 1234. Show your work.              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
8*5^3 + 8*5^2 + 6*5^1 + 4*5^0

I divided 1234/5 and get the remainder as well and divide the remainder by 5 and keep doing that until I get a value for each number

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Task 4: Showcase the output of to_base(48879, 16) and hex(48879).            |
| Compare the output of your functions with the output of the built-in. Any    |
| interesting observations?                                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
(11, 14, 14, 15)
0xbec7

While my to_base function returns a tuple with each multiple of base 16, hex returns the number in hexedecimal format

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Task 4: Were your calculations for Task 1 correct? You should use your       |
| functions to verify them.                                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
I was returned (1, 4, 4, 1, 4) which is kind of not what I did before so I think I might've done something wrong and my calculations were incorrect

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Did you encounter any problems while doing this assignment? If so, how did   |
| you resolve them?                                                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
To be honest the to_int function was easy to make and run but the to_base was a lot harder because I needed to think about how to "divide" each number by a certain base^number power
