I spent a few hours on this assignment, mostly because I didn't work on it dedicatedly at first. However, once I sat down after lab and focused on it, things started clicking. The easiest function to understand was the parsing one because the logic just made sense—reading a file, validating the format, and converting strings to integers felt straightforward. The strategy that really helped me understand the shortest path function was thinking about it in terms of a grid. Imagining the distance table as an actual grid made the backtracking process much more viable and intuitive. I realized I could work backwards from my target point and visualize moving left or up through the grid, which made the algorithm feel less abstract and more concrete.
