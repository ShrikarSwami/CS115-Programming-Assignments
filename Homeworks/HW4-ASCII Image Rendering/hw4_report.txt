| Task 1: What are the RGB values of the top-left pixel?                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Put your answer here.
The top left pixel is (255,255,255)

| Task 1: Explain as you would to your non-hacker friends how the RGB values  |
| are encoded in this image format.                                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Put your answer here.
The PPM file basically stores colors in text, so the first line would say something like P3 then next gives the width and height of the image, then a max value which is 255. Then after that, each pixel is written as three numbers: Red, Green, and Blue. Like for example, 255 0 0 means a pixel that is purely red because it is in RGB. Each row of numbers represents one row of pixels, os its like a text version of an image grid that Python can read line by line.

I ran the test_hw4 a bunch of times to see what tests I was failing and the main issue I had was from "\n\r" instead of "\r\n" and I fixed it by checking the expectations and I also printed a small sample image to see how ASCII conversion looks because that was my most favorite one to write out of all the methods

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Put your answer here.
The main problem was my line endings \n\r vs \r\n which caused a bunch of failures. Another challenge was trying to remember that the image gets mutated in place, so reusing variables caused confusion. I just kept running it until I figures out what the errors were coming from
