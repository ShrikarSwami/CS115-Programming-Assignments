| List a useful shorcut you've found in IDLE. What is the shortcut, and what   |
| does it do? How would you accomplish the same thing without the shortcut?    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Put your answer here.
FN+F5, this shortcut runs your code as well as opens IDLE Shell which is useful for when I test the file in my own program but when I want to run the lab tests and only make tiny changes. Without the shortcut I would just go to the top right of the screen and press run

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Put your answer here.
I ran into the issue of writing 'none' instead of 'None' so my program was not working but besides that everything else worked out.
